# TRAFFIC-PREDICTION-FOR-INTELLIGENT-TRANSPORTATION-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

The most important challenge to sustainable mobility is persistent congestions of differing strength and duration in the dense transport networks. The standard Adaptive Traffic Signal Control cannot properly address this kind of congestion. Deep learning-based mechanisms have proved their significance to anticipate in adjective outcomes to improve the decision making on the predictions of traffic length. The deep learning models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a simplifying human life. Several methods are being popularly used to handle real time problems occurring from traffic congestion. This study demonstrates the capability of DL models to overcome the traffic congestion by simply allowing the vehicles through a signal depending on the length of vehicles.

Our proposed method integrates a numeral of approach,intended to advance the cooperativeness of the explore operation. In this work, we develop the application to regulate the traffic by releasing better signal at desired time intervals. we Have also implemented the application to detect the number of vehicles in the images from the user and gives vehicles counts. To detect the vehicles count here we are using the YOLO pretrained weights.
